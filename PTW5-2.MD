<h4>If you created your own Read Me or HTML page on GitHub, was GitHub's Markdown Cheat Sheet or W3schools' HTML tutorial a useful aid? Describe your experience using the guide to help you create your page(s).
</h4>

<ul> 
  <li> Yes, using the W3school's HTML tutorial was helpful for several reasons. 1.) It helped me understand what is the appropriate syntax for HTML markup. In previous roles, I've known how to do the basics like bold and headers. This is the first time I have ever created an unnumbered list! Small wins :) 2.) I never fully understood what the purpose or value was of making different headers (why not just bold or change the font size?) and I learned that search engines use to index and structure pages. 3.) The 'try it yourself' makes it easy to test the code and have real world experience. 4.) Disovered that empty tags don't have an end tag </li>
  <li> Creating this GitHub page, I still feel like I am in the very beginning stages of what is possible. It's, honestly, hard for me to type in the coding window of GitHub and vizualize how it will turn out. There seems to be a lot of flipping back and forth. I didn't want to cheat/take a shortcut and write in an HTML editior and then copy into GitHub. It would be nice if you could be typing and see how it would be styled next to the window vs. having to take breaks to save and then view. </li> 
  </ul>

<h4>If this was your first markdown or HTML experience (then, congratulations!), what challenges did you encounter? What successes did you have? What questions do you have for the future (or what would you still like to learn)? </h4>  
 <ul> 
   <li> Challenges include getting more complicated with the HTML markup. I tried to make my H1 MediumSeaGreen and I can't figure out why it's not turning green. The GitHub editor doens't do a great job of formating so you can see the tags. In previous roles I have used Notepad++ which does a fantastic job with organzing the syntax and color coding so you can see where you're at.   </li> 
   <li> Success includes what you're seeing! I have been able to successfully create different headers and bulleted lists. Using the 'Try it Yourself' feature I was able to test around with styles, images, alt-text, etc </li> 
   </ul>

 <h4> How might you use this activity (creating the webpages or markdown pages) going forward? Do you have some project in mind? </h4>
  <ul> 
    <li> Going forward, I don't think I will use the markdown to code an entire site. I think I will continue use to modifiy webpages. In prior roles I have had to update the HTML code to get the formating a bit more perfect and that is where I see myself using this capability. </li> 
    <li> For my final deliverable, I plan to use when building my Wordpress page. It would be a great learning for me to try updating Wordpress with HTML editing vs. using the out of the box. </li>
